ES5 - Current javascript. Currently, this is the standard as declared by W3C.
ES6 - new javascript. It is not a standard right now.

>>Learn the differences between them.

New features in ES6:
1. const keyword
2. let keyword : Its scope is at block level. Eg: let a = 10;
3. var scope is at the function level.
4. class keyword.
Eg: 

class Person{
	constructor(){ ...... }
	sayHi(){ .........}
}

const p = new Person();
p.sayHi();

5. Inheritance is now allowed in ES6.
6. Array has been refined. Concept of fat arrow has been introduced.
EG:
const arr = [3,4,1,10,20,32,5];
arr.filter(item => item < 10)
   .map(item => "item is " + item);


Eg: const add => (x,y) = return x + y;


----------Angular JS -------------------------
We need to add 
 ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { default: 500, blur: 0 } }"
to avoid the api call every time asyncronously. We can give delay to the api hit.

Interceptors
-------------


Decorators:
-----------
$exceptionHandler, $http - built in angular service.
$delegate ->Built in Exception handler.
We can use decorators to build custom exception handlers.

Webpack
--------
--It helps in bundling all the js files.

CLI
----
Command line interface.
Helps in project scaffolding.

1. To create a new application folder along with all dependencies.
>ng new angular5-shopping-cart

2. Change directory
>cd <to new folder>

3. To launch the application
> ng serve 


karma -> It is test runner tool. Helps in Unit testing.
Protactor -> It is a end to end testing tool.
tsconfig -> Configurations for typescript.
tslint -> Default rules for typescript.

Comparison of Angular5 and AngularJS
-------------------------------------
1. Both has concept of modules(like a package).
2. Both has concept of components.
3. Both has concept of Services.
4. Both has concept of Directives.

5. AngularJS is dependent wholly on browser. 
6. Server side rendering (SSR)
7.Angular 5 is divided in 
	Core Layer(Platform independent) and View Layer(Platform dependent)
8. Ang5 has Native-script feature -> Helps in creating native mobile app.
9. In Ang5 Data flows down(helps in pin pointing the component) and events flow up. This increases the performance of the application.
10. > ng g c components/productList -> Creates a new component along with dependencies.
11. > ng g s app -> Creates a service class automatically in the code and adds it in config files.
